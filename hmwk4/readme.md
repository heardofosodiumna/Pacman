### What did you use for obstacle avoidance?<br/>
+ #### You can use ray cast, cone check or collision predication<br/>
  + ##### For ray cast, you can use Unity’s function if you wish<br/>
+ #### You cannot just use the colliders in Unity<br/>
We used ray cast for avoiding walls. Collision predition for avoiding each other.<br/>
### What are the heuristics for the agents to go through the tunnels
We check and see when the flock is apporachiing the tunnel, when it is about to then it reorganized it to go through the tunner.<br/>
### Did you use any additional heuristics?
No.
### What are the differences in the three groups’ performances?
